# Primes

### How to run this application

The application itself is a python script, `primes.py`.

I have included a docker-compose file which will take care of the creation of the execution environment for the `primes.py` script, for which I've chosen to use Docker. This will ensure that anyone executing the script will have the same experience as the developer, and also will allow functional testing of the container with Travis-CI.

`example docker-compose command invocation`
